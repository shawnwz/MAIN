Each episode dives into the cutthroat world of these heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport the un-shippable. The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. From rookie haulers to seasoned veterans, no shipment is too big for these professionals to handle. Marc, Jarrett, Jennifer, Roy and his beloved cat Muffy are back, along with new cast members Chris and Robbie. One of the industry's most unique shippers, Chris's edge in the business comes from his truck, which runs off of a waste vegetable oil system that he invented himself.

In this character driven treasure hunt, bidders range from twenty something's out for fun and adventure - willing to say or do anything to win - to husband and wife teams looking to make fast and large cash and all are prepared to create quite the drama in the process. It's a dramatic environment as the bidders assess if they think the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go. In each self-contained episode, our cast of characters head to storage units and wait anxiously for the big reveal of what is behind the door. The owner of the facility will cut the lock to a delinquent unit and raise the door for the first time, allowing bidders to peer inside for a brief moment, aided only by a flashlight.",

In the past 10 years, he's turned around and made successes out of over 100 companies. Now he's bringing his expertise and remarkable business acumen to television in an unprecedented series.

In the past 10 years, he's turned around and made successes out of over 100 companies. Now he's bringing his expertise and remarkable business acumen to television in an unprecedented series. In an effort to help struggling small businesses, Lemonis puts a substantial amount of his own money on the line for a percentage of the business and its profits. Once inside these companies, he'll do almost anything to save the business while making a profit, even if it means doing the work himself, promoting the secretary or firing high-ranking employees.",

In this character driven treasure hunt, bidders range from twenty something's out for fun and adventure - willing to say or do anything to win - to husband and wife teams looking to make fast and large cash and all are prepared to create quite the drama in the process. It's a dramatic environment as the bidders assess if they think the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go. In each self-contained episode, our cast of characters head to storage units and wait anxiously for the big reveal of what is behind the door. The owner of the facility will cut the lock to a delinquent unit and raise the door for the first time, allowing bidders to peer inside for a brief moment, aided only by a flashlight.",

It's a dramatic environment as the bidders assess if they think the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go. In each self-contained episode, our cast of characters head to storage units and wait anxiously for the big reveal of what is behind the door. The owner of the facility will cut the lock to a delinquent unit and raise the door for the first time, allowing bidders to peer inside for a brief moment, aided only by a flashlight.",

In this character driven treasure hunt, bidders range from twenty something's out for fun and adventure - willing to say or do anything to win - to husband and wife teams looking to make fast and large cash and all are prepared to create quite the drama in the process. It's a dramatic environment as the bidders assess if they think the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go. In each self-contained episode, our cast of characters head to storage units and wait anxiously for the big reveal of what is behind the door. The owner of the facility will cut the lock to a delinquent unit and raise the door for the first time, allowing bidders to peer inside for a brief moment, aided only by a flashlight.",

In this character driven treasure hunt, bidders range from twenty something's out for fun and adventure - willing to say or do anything to win - to husband and wife teams looking to make fast and large cash and all are prepared to create quite the drama in the process. It's a dramatic environment as the bidders assess if they think the unit is worth a bid and how high they will actually go. In each self-contained episode, our cast of characters head to storage units and wait anxiously for the big reveal of what is behind the door. The owner of the facility will cut the lock to a delinquent unit and raise the door for the first time, allowing bidders to peer inside for a brief moment, aided only by a flashlight.",
